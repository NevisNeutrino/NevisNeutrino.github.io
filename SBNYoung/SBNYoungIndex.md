# Things we wish we'd known... SBN Young

So you've found this page, chances are that means you're a student or postdoc new to SBN. SBN Young is a group consisting of, and representing the interests of, all young collaborators of SBND and ICARUS.
This guide is intended to provide resources to help you get started in SBN. It's a compilation of any guides and documentation we could find / write ourselves and is by no means complete but we hope it helps you get up to speed!
Thanks to the authors of the SBND & ICARUS Newbie Guides from which we ported some of this information.
