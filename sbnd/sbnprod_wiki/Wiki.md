==========================================

Here you will found how to make production sample requests as well as (comming soon) instructions and documentation

Available Samples 
--------------------------
A table with information about the official available samples can be found at the [SBN Production Available Samples Page](/sbn/sbnprod_wiki/sample)

Production Guidelines for SBN-wide Data and MonteCarlo Production
--------------------------
The [SBN Production Guidelines document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ykYBhHZCHaak-JDuod9I3-GwetaiptGRgLGJG6zOKf4/edit?usp=sharing) outlines the SBN-wide production process, which governs production and data processing for SBN joint analyses, and individual SBND and ICARUS analyses. Comments can be added to the document or brought to your group convener. 

Production Sample requests 
--------------------------

The SBN Production Group is reponsible for MC sample productions and DATA processing for SBND and ICARUS.

To submit a request to production, please fill the [SBN Production Request Form](https://forms.gle/V9XkhdwXj7FsxBj28). The responsible parties should be automatically notified but you can also notify the official group email address: [sbn-mc-prod@fnal.gov](sbn-mc-prod@fnal.gov)

The form is also a checklist of the needed information. If you need help answering any number of the questions on the survey, please contact your group convener and/or production group conveners. Status of open requests can be checked at the [SBN Production Requests Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17mFPGsP7gw4GRLSCwIL15QrtUnLVri_2k2Wjzhd6Ork/edit?usp=sharing). If you need to edit the request, please edit your answers to the form.
