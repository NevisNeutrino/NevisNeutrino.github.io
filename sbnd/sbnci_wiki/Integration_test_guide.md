Short user guide to integration tests in SBND
==============================================================================================================


What are integration tests 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SBND has two levels of tests:

1.  *unit tests* are small tests targeting a single feature or module;
    you run it with `mrb test -j16` or equivalent^[1]^
2.  *integration tests* exercise a complete chain of processing

Before pushing code that has any remote chance of changing existing
results, you should run both. This guide is about the latter.\
Every time code is pushed to the `sbndcode` or `icaruscode``develop` branch, tests are 
automatically triggered.



What an integration test does 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

An integration test does what it is asked to by its configuration at
[[source:test/ci/ci\_tests.cfg](/redmine/projects/sbndcode/repository/entry/test/ci/ci_tests.cfg){.source}]{style="font-family: monospace;"}.\
Each test may include:

1.  run a LArSoft job
2.  compare the size of the output (in particular, the length of the
    data product collections) with a reference result
3.  compare selected histograms from the output with reference results

If any of the steps fails, the test fails and the failure is reported.
For failures in running the job, the solution is for the author to just
fix the code. For failures in the comparison with the reference results,
the mismatch must be studied to determine whether the change is
acceptable or not. In the former case the reference results need to be
updated, in the latter again the code must be fixed.



Introduction to test running 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

For this introduction we run the tests in the local area (as in section
4.2 below).

The script `test_runner` will execute the requested integration tests.
Since it relies on the settings from the current UPS environment, no
particular setup is needed, except for the UPS product containing the
script, but you need to **[get a certificate
proxy](Get_a_certificate_proxy.html)** since the input is
read from dCache. So:

    setup lar_ci
    test_runner develop_test_sbndcode

will run the tests designed to be run during development.



### The output of a test in detail 

The information of this section somehow depends on both the version of
the test SBND provides, and the version of `lar_ci`. The following
information was compiled using `sbndcode v06_68_00` and `lar_ci v3_3_0`.

We use as example the detector propagation test.\
The list of available tests is:

    $ test-runner -l
    The current parallel limit is: 5
    suite quick_test_sbndcode: (5 tests)
      ci_anatree_regression_quick_test_sbndcode
      ci_detsim_regression_quick_test_sbndcode
      ci_g4_regression_quick_test_sbndcode
      ci_gen_regression_quick_test_sbndcode
      ci_reco_basic_regression_quick_test_sbndcode
    suite seq_test_sbndcode: (5 tests)
      ci_anatree_regression_seq_test_sbndcode
      ci_detsim_regression_seq_test_sbndcode
      ci_g4_regression_seq_test_sbndcode
      ci_gen_regression_seq_test_sbndcode
      ci_reco_basic_regression_seq_test_sbndcode
    suite develop_test_sbndcode: (5 tests)
      ci_anatree_regression_quick_test_sbndcode
      ci_detsim_regression_quick_test_sbndcode
      ci_g4_regression_quick_test_sbndcode
      ci_gen_regression_quick_test_sbndcode
      ci_reco_basic_regression_quick_test_sbndcode
    Tests in no suites:

\
We have 10 tests, and three suites that may share them. We can ask
`test_runner` to run a single test, or a whole suite, or many of the
above.\
The detector propagation test is `ci_g4_regression_quick_test_sbndcode`:

    $ setup lar_ci
    $ mkdir -p run_ci
    $ cd run_ci
    $ test-runner --statistics ci_g4_regression_quick_test_sbndcode

\
(the `copy_out_results check point None false None None False` is debug
output that will be removed soon, see issue

It shows a job failure, and the `errors.log` explains (in its own way)

\
This is a winner. A local directory
`ci_g4_regression_quick_test_sbndcode` was created, with:

  ---------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  `histocmp.html`                                would contain rendering of comparison plots; empty because this test does not extract plots
  `memory.db`                                    *art* output (from `MemoryTracker` service)
  `cputime.db`                                   *art* output (from `TimeTracker` service)
  `hist-sbnd_ci_sbndcode_quick_single_g4.root`   *art* output (from `TFileService` service)
  `messages.log`                                 main output of LArSoft job on screen (*art* output from message facility service, as configured in SBND)
  `errors.log`                                   error output stream of LArSoft job (*art* output from message facility service, as configured in SBND)
  `stdout.log`                                   output to screen of (most of) the test\_runner script, including also \"event dumps\" for both new and reference results, and some error messages from LArSoft job
  `data_production_stats.log`                    encoded error information *(only on error)*
  `stderr.log`                                   error output stream of (most of) the test\_runner script
  `result.log`                                   test validation output
  `avgevent_times.log`                           average CPU times (broken when using `TimeTracker`)
  ---------------------------------------------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



### Example of failure from resource usage 

This is the output of `test_runner` after a successful LArSoft job has
used more resources (or less!) than expected:\

    The current parallel limit is: 5
    Test Suite:  ci_g4_regression_quick_test_sbndcode
    Expanded:  ci_g4_regression_quick_test_sbndcode
    Memory usage 285648.000000 not in 200000.000000:210000.000000 range
    Statistic: ci_g4_regression_quick_test_sbndcode exitcode 102
    [...]

\
To obtain it, I artificially decreased the limit of (resident size)
memory for the test to about 210 MB.



Running the integration test with the Continuous Integration system 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are mainly three ways to run an integration test:

1.  automatically, by pushing into a `develop` branch
2.  locally, testing the code in the local development area
3.  remotely, testing the code in the GIT remote repositories

Currently tests are run on SLF7.



### Automatic testing 

Whenever a commit is pushed to a `develop` branch, a test is
automatically triggered. The test starts 15 minutes after the first push
to `develop`, to give the user the time to push into different
repositories as needed.

-   if the push is in `sbndcode`, only `sbndcode` is built and tested
-   if the push is (also) in the `develop` branch of a LArSoft
    repository, the C.I. system will check out and build all LArSoft,
    `sbndcode` and also the code from the other LArSoft-based
    experiments; this is to ensure that one experiment\'s change does
    not disrupt the others

The result of the test can be checked in the [C.I.
dashboard](http://dbweb5.fnal.gov:8080/LarCI/app/ns:sbnd/view_builds)
(on the top raw, you can select LArSoft or SBND to monitor the
respective tests).

In this case, the quick test suite is executed (`quick_test_sbndcode`,
chosen by the SBND `lar_ci` workflow configuration).



### Testing of the code in the local working area 

Before pushing the code anywhere, integration tests may be executed
locally from the MRB area^[1]^ where the code has just been
compiled (see also above, the \"Introduction to test running\" section).
The commands to do so are:\

    setup lar_ci
    test_runner --verbose develop_test_sbndcode

\
Among the useful options: `--parallel-limit=12` will run at most 12
tests in parallel, instead than one after the other.

^1^ In fact, they can be run even without a MRB area, in an environment
where `sbndcode` is already set up.



### Remote testing of published code 

The Continuous Integration system can build and test any publicly
available branch. To ask for the SBND integration tests, use the
`sbndcode_wf` workflow:\

    setup lar_ci
    trigger --build-delay 0 --workflow sbndcode_wf

\
This will run the \"quick\" test, just like if it had been triggered
automatically. The `--build-delay 0` option tells the system to start as
soon as possible (instead of waiting for 15 minutes, which would be
pointless since we are not pushing anything any more).

In general, the supported workflows are listed in the [list of supported
SBND workflows](LArCI_Workflows.html#SBND-CI-Workflows).

TODO: document how to run on branches\
TODO: document how to run other tests



#### Generating the reference files

After having concluded there is the need to update reference files, a
single command will do the trick:\

    trigger --build-delay 0 --workflow Update_ref_files_SBNDCODE_wf --force-platform slf6

(there is the usual requirement of having a grid proxy and `lar_ci` set
up).\
The `Update_ref_files_SBNDCODE_wf` is a special workflow used for this
purpose only, and we use only one reference platform, assuming (wrongly)
that all platforms will give the same results.



The reference result files 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The reference result files are currently stored in dCache:\

    /pnfs/sbnd/persistent/ContinuousIntegration/reference

\
(see the `XROOTD_REFERENCEFILEDIR_SBNDCODE` key in the `DEFAULT` section
of
[[source:test/ci/ci\_tests.cfg](/redmine/projects/sbndcode/repository/entry/test/ci/ci_tests.cfg){.source}]{style="font-family: monospace;"}
and the related keys `BASEFILERELPATH_SBNDCODE` and
`XROOTD_BASEFILEDIR_SBNDCODE`).



Available tests 
--------------------------------------------------

The available tests can be printed with `test-runner --list-tests` (`-l`
for short).\
Test suites should be documented at the beginning of
[[source:test/ci/ci\_tests.cfg](/redmine/projects/sbndcode/repository/entry/test/ci/ci_tests.cfg){.source}]{style="font-family: monospace;"}
configuration file.\
A summary of the test suites (which will fall sadly out of date with
time):

  --------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------
  **test suite name**               **description**                                                                                  **run time**
  **`develop_test_sbndcode`**       tests intended to be run during code development                                                 4300/1200 kVs
  `complete_test_sbndcode`          tests intended to be run before final push (take longer than `develop_test_sbndcode`)            12000/6200 kVs
  `quick_test_sbndcode`             includes both single particle and data-like event quick tests                                    4300/1200 kVs
  `seq_test_sbndcode`               includes both single particle and data-like event sequences tests                                7600/6200 kVs
  `single_quick_test_sbndcode`      single particle (`prodsingle_sbnd.fcl`) 5-stage chain, each step from reference file             800/450 kVs
  `nucosmics_quick_test_sbndcode`   data-like neutrino and background (GENIE+CORSIKA) 5-stage chain, each step from reference file   3500/1200 kVs
  `single_seq_test_sbndcode`        data-like single particle (`prodsingle_sbnd.fcl`) 5-stage chain, in sequence                     1400/1400 kVs
  `nucosmics_seq_test_sbndcode`     neutrino and background (GENIE+CORSIKA) 5-stage chain, in sequence                               6200/6200 kVs
  `gallery_test_sbndcode`           runs tests related to the gallery examples in `sbndcode`                                         
  `generate_reference_sbndcode`     reruns all the jobs generating output files that can be used as reference^[1]^             5800/5800 kVs
  `all_tests_sbndcode`              reruns all tests (used for maintenance only)                                                     12000/6200 kVs
  --------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------

^1^ The test suite `generate_reference_sbndcode` is used by default by
the workflow to update reference files (`Update_ref_files_SBNDCODE_wf`).
To use a different one, `trigger` should be explicitly provided with a
`--gen-ref-tests` option.

Most quick tests typically run just one or two events.\
The run time in the table is the normalised one as reported by the C.I.
scripts, and it is heavily approximated. The first figure collects the
integrated time, while the second is the ideal run time when all tests
are run in parallel (for example, sequential tests can\'t be
parallelised). The figures were obtained from `sbndbuild01.fnal.gov`;
for reference, 1000 kVs on that machine take about 3 CPU minutes.



Investigating test failures 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------



### Results are different from the reference 

The reference files are normally generated with a special trigger, as
described above. These special jobs are shown in the
[dashboard](http://dbweb5.fnal.gov:8080/LarCI/app/ns:sbnd/view_builds/index)
as `sbnd_ci` builds with workflow `Update_ref_files_SBNDCODE`, and can
be recognised because they have a table header with more columns,
including a column `gen_ref_files`. A completed reference file job
replaces the previous reference files, so the current files come from
the most recent reference file job.

When comparing the result of a failed test, it may be useful to
precisely know the difference in the source code. The exact commit of
the code used to generate the reference result can be seen hovering the
mouse on the `checkout` column of the most recent reference file job.
For example, `sbnd_ci/32`, generating reference files on 2018-03-09
09:02, had:

    larana             LARSOFT_SUITE_v06_70_01
    larcore            LARSOFT_SUITE_v06_70_01
    larcorealg         LARSOFT_SUITE_v06_70_01
    larcoreobj         LARSOFT_SUITE_v06_70_01
    lardata            LARSOFT_SUITE_v06_70_01-6-g00d39317
    lardataobj         LARSOFT_SUITE_v06_70_01
    lareventdisplay    LARSOFT_SUITE_v06_70_01
    larevt             LARSOFT_SUITE_v06_70_01
    larexamples        LARSOFT_SUITE_v06_70_01
    larpandora         LARSOFT_SUITE_v06_70_01
    larpandoracontent  LARSOFT_SUITE_v06_70_01
    larreco            LARSOFT_SUITE_v06_70_01-2-g3db95cef
    larsim             LARSOFT_SUITE_v06_70_01
    larsoft            LARSOFT_SUITE_v06_70_01
    larsoftobj         LARSOFT_SUITE_v06_70_01
    larwirecell        LARSOFT_SUITE_v06_70_01
    sbndcode           v06_70_01-3-g28fc0d2

\
The codes shown there are from `git describe`, and `git` usually accepts
them where a commit hash of a tag would be required. If the failure was
from a remote job, you will get an e-mail with a history of recent
commits (for `sbndcode` only), and comparing to the reference tag for
`sbndcode` you can see which additional commits were used in your test.
In the example above, `v06_70_01-3-g28fc0d2` is the reference tag, which
is formed by an actual base tag (`v06_70_01`), the number of commits
beyond it (`3`) and the hash of the head commit (`28fc0d2`, introduced
by the `g` letter). In this case, the correct commit is
[28fc0d2](/redmine/projects/sbndcode/repository/revisions/28fc0d251f9f5e26f356995f3861fcf9cdc2a7b6 "Tests now use a special single-file flux configuration centrally defined"){.changeset}.



Further resources 
------------------------------------------------------

The hub for information on integration tests is the project
[lar\_ci](/redmine/projects/lar_ci){.project}.\
Our contact to that system is, at the time of writing, [Vito Di
Benedetto](mailto:vito@fnal.gov).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

^1^ If the working area is already built, you can run all the tests
with:

    cd "$MRB_BUILDDIR" 
    ctest -j16

You can also go to the subdirectory of `$MRB_BUILDDIR` that contains the
tests you care of, instead, and you\'ll end up running only the tests
under that directory.
